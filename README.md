# Sorting-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a Python project that brings sorting algorithms to life through interactive visualizations. This project implements several popular sorting techniques, allowing users to see how data is arranged step-by-step.

## Features :
### Interactive Visualization:

Watching how different sorting algorithms organize data, helping you understand the inner workings of each method easily.

### Multiple Sorting Techniques:
The visualizer includes various sorting algorithms such as: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

### User-Friendly Interface: 
Easily select and run different sorting algorithms to see how they perform.

## Purpose:
The goal of this project is to make learning sorting algorithms more engaging and intuitive. By visualizing the process, users can gain a deeper understanding of how each algorithm operates, which can be especially useful for students and educators.

## Getting Started :
Clone the repository.

Install the necessary Python libraries.

Run the main script to start the visualizer.

## Future Enhancements :
Adding more algorithms other than sorting like 'how 2 pointer approach work' etc.

Improving the user interface with additional customization options.

Optimizing performance for larger datasets or for input array.

## Contributing :
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new features or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
